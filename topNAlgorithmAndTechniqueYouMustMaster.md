For any scientist and engineer in advanced medical imaging computing field.
You should master below algorithm and technique. Maninly for software point of view


[1] SVM: You should not only know how to use it, you should can  derivate of dual formulation. 
[2] Divide and conquer thchnique: for example quick sort, binary search
[3] DP: DP could be very broadly range. But you should master some commonly used DP algorithms
[4] Graph algorithms: shorest path, DFS, BFS, topological sort
[5] min/max heap, together with graph shorest path
[6] Tree structure. 
[7] regression
[8]
