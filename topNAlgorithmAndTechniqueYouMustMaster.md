For any scientist and engineer in advanced medical imaging computing field.
You should master below algorithm and technique. Maninly for software point of view

1. SVM: You should not only know how to use it, you should can derivate the dual formulation of SVM. 
2. Divide and conquer thchnique: for example quick sort, binary search
3. DP: DP could be very broadly range. But you should master some commonly used DP algorithms. such as clibe stairs, shorest path for an image along each rows, etc.
4. Graph algorithms: shorest path, DFS, BFS, topological sort
5. min/max heap, together with graph shorest path
6. Tree structure. 
7. regression
8. K-NN: nearest neighbor search
9. Commonly used data structure: vector, map, set pair, std::sort, boost smart pointer,
